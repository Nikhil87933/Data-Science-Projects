Title: Real-time Fraud Detection for Australian Banking Client

Description:

PredCatch Analytics is tasked with addressing a critical issue faced by their Australian banking client - a surge in fraudulent ATM transactions affecting both profitability and reputation. The solution proposed involves building a predictive model to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time, with the ultimate goal of reducing or eliminating such instances.

The challenge lies in the imbalance of the dataset, where fraudulent transactions are significantly outnumbered by clean transactions. To enhance the effectiveness of the model, additional data has been collected, including location information (geo_scores), a proprietary index (Lambda_wts), network turn around times (Qset_tats), and vulnerability qualification scores (instance_scores). While the specific meanings of these variables are not required at this stage, they will contribute to the robustness of the model.

The target variable for prediction is 'Target,' where 1 denotes fraudulent transactions and 0 represents clean transactions.

The success of this model is critical, as it has the potential to significantly mitigate the impact of fraudulent transactions on the client's profitability and reputation. If successful, the next step involves presenting the solution to the client, explaining the model's functionality, and outlining its capabilities in real-time fraud detection and prevention.

The project's focus is on leveraging advanced analytics to create a powerful fraud detection system that can identify and decline potentially fraudulent transactions, ultimately safeguarding the client's interests. The incorporation of location data, proprietary indices, and network-related information adds depth to the predictive model, enhancing its ability to discern fraudulent activities.
